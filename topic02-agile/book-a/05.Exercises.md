# Exercises

Form into teams of 2-3 and tackle the following exercises

## Exercise 1:

As a team define your:

1. Definition of Done
2. Your Story Point Scale for numbers 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8

## Exercise 2:

Taking the Baseline requirements, produce a set of User Stories to capture the requirements. Bear in mind that the Baseline requirements incorporate the Starter requirements. To get you started:

* As a User, I want a report that lists my Current BMI


 You may introduce a Developer Persona to help you flesh out some of the technical details where it makes sense:

* As a Developer, I want details stored in a YAML file

In the interests of time, aim for 3-5 additional requirements.

## Exercise 3:

Taking your User Stories, we want to produce a Sprint Backlog of developer focused tasks to achieve them.

1. Produce Developer Tasks for each User Story that combined adhere to your Definition of Done
2. Story Point each 

## Exercise 4:

Form your first backlog! 

We order out backlog based on stakeholder value and priority. Try ordering your backlog:

1. By the most difficult first, developers are often drawn to this
2. By the order that makes sense to build a prototype
3. By business value, in this case, by the features that will get you the most marks! Ask your lecturer!

## Exercise 5

In your own time, try and produce a full Sprint Backlog, complete with all requirements for the Outstanding requirements. This will bring in multiple personas and give you a very rich set of stories and developer tasks. Compare what you have produced with your original attempt at breaking up the project.
