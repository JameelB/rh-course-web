# Creating an image & running it

## Creating
 
A Docker image is essentially a snapshot of a container. When used with the `docker run` command, they are used to create a running instance of a container.
To create a Docker image you need a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is essentially a set of instructions that Docker uses to create the Docker image.
Example:
https://github.com/feedhenry/wit-docker-example

To create an image from this example, first clone it.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/feedhenry/wit-docker-example.git
```

The build the image:

```bash
$ cd wit-docker-example
$ docker build .
```
