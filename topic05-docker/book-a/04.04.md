# Running containers remotely

## Deploying to a 'docker machine'

A 'docker machine' is a remote instance running docker. More info on setting one up can be found at https://docs.docker.com/machine/.
Deploying a container to a remote docker-machine can be done using the `docker` cli. Instead of all commands running against your local machine, they run against the remote machine.

## Deploying to a kubernetes cluster

Kubernetes is a system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. If you have a kubernets cluster, you can run docker containers in that cluster via kubernets templates & the `kubectl` cli. https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/

## Deploying to an OpenShift cluster

If you have an OpenShift cluster (based on kubernetes), you can run docker containers in that cluster via openshift templates & the `oc` cli. https://openshift.io/
